An affable country gentleman, Darwin at first shocked religious Victorian society by suggesting that animals and humans shared a common ancestry. However, his nonreligious biology appealed to the rising class of professional scientists, and by the time of his death evolutionary imagery had spread through all of science, literature, and politics.

His formulation of (circular) inertia, the law of falling bodies, and parabolic trajectories marked the beginning of a fundamental change in the study of motion. His insistence that the book of nature was written in the language of mathematics changed natural philosophy from a verbal, qualitative account to a mathematical one in which experimentation became a recognized method for discovering the facts of nature. Finally, his discoveries with the telescope revolutionized astronomy and paved the way for the acceptance of the Copernican heliocentric system, but his advocacy of that system eventually resulted in an Inquisition process against him.', image_url: 'https://cdn.britannica.com/29/18829-050-3F57E4F8/Galileo-Justus-Sustermans-Uffizi-Gallery-Florence-1637.jpg', info_url: 'https://www.britannica.com/biography/Galileo-Galilei', owner: diana)

In optics, his discovery of the composition of white light integrated the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the foundation for modern physical optics. In mechanics, his three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation. In mathematics, he was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus.

This representation of the heavens is usually called the heliocentric, or “Sun-centred,” system—derived from the Greek helios, meaning “Sun.” Copernicus’s theory had important consequences for later thinkers of the Scientific Revolution, including such major figures as Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, and Newton. Copernicus probably hit upon his main idea sometime between 1508 and 1514, and during those years he wrote a manuscript usually called the Commentariolus (“Little Commentary”). However, the book that contains the final version of his theory, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium libri vi (“Six Books Concerning the Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs”), did not appear in print until 1543, the year of his death.', image_url: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg', info_url: 'https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicolaus-Copernicus', owner: diana)

Kepler himself did not call these discoveries “laws,” as would become customary after Isaac Newton derived them from a new and quite different set of general physical principles. He regarded them as celestial harmonies that reflected God’s design for the universe. Kepler’s discoveries turned Nicolaus Copernicus’s Sun-centred system into a dynamic universe, with the Sun actively pushing the planets around in noncircular orbits.

The Swiss American astronomer Fritz Zwicky had in 1933 observed that the mass of stars within a galaxy that he observed was insufficient to keep the galaxy from flying apart, and he deduced that there must be some “missing mass” holding the galaxy together. In the 1970s Rubin, working with her colleague Kent Ford, began measuring the rotation of spiral galaxies and found that stars on the outer edges of galaxies spun at least as fast around the centre as those in the inner regions, counter to Rubin’s expectations. Rubin examined more than 60 spiral galaxies and found that her original observations were borne out in every case. The existence of a substantial amount of dark matter provided the most-reasonable explanation for those findings. Rubin studied astronomy at Vassar College, graduating in 1948. She earned (1951) a master’s degree from Cornell University and (1954) a Ph.D. from Georgetown University. Her doctoral thesis showed that galaxies are not distributed uniformly but instead are found in clumps. After teaching at Montgomery College and at Georgetown, Rubin joined (1965) the Carnegie Institution, where she spent the majority of her career. In the mid-1960s she was the first woman permitted to use the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory at Caltech.
